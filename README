This code base will allow the user to recreate the figures associated with the paper Space-Time Ambiguity Functions for Electronically Scanned ISR Applications. The code is a mixture of MATLAB and Python Code. The original I\Q is created and fitted in Python while the interpolation and fitting is done in MATLAB. All of the MATLAB code is in the directory MATLAB while all of the Python code is in the directory RadarDataSim.

In order to use the Python code the folder RadarDataSim/RadarDataSim must be on the python path. To do this the user can execute the following command

python setup.py

To create the data products needed first run either patchexamp.py patchexampstationary.py or patchwtemp.py. To then make the 3-D plots first they must be interpolated using the MATLAB tools. Simply put all of the matfiles from the python script into the matlab folder and run interpall.m which will create all of the interpolated data in Cartisian space.

Final Figure Creation.

Following is a list of along with the script used to create them.  

Figure 3: Run ambsurf.m with the function AMISR_Pattern.m in your path and lp240_20 in the same directory.

Figure 4: Run ambsurfwtime.m with the function AMISR_Pattern.m in your path and lp240_20 in the same 
directory.
Figures 7 and 13: Use the script altplots.py in 
Figures 8, 10 and 11: Use plottingex2.m to create the figures. The data files
origdata.mat, origdata2.mat and patchex.mat will be required to run the code. The data can be
recreated by running the code in the python code library.

Figure 12:Use plottingstation.m to create the figure. The data files
origdatastation.mat, origdatastation2.mat and patchexstation.mat will be required to run the code. The data can be
recreated by running the code in the python code library.


Figures 14, and 15: Use plottingex4.m to create the figures. The data files
origdatatemp.mat and patchewtemp.mat will be required to run the code. The data can be
recreated by running the code in the python code library.

Figure 16:Use the script RadarDataSim/bin/fitsurfacepatch.py. Need the data files ACFdata.mat, Noisedata.mat, patchewtemp.mat and patchwtempfit.mat.

Figure 17: Use the script RadarDataSim/bin/showspecs.py. Need the data files ACFdata.mat, Noisedata.mat, patchewtemp.mat and patchwtempfit.mat.
