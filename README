This code base will allow the user to recreate the figures associated with the paper Space-Time Ambiguity Functions for Electronically Scanned ISR Applications. The code is a mixture of MATLAB and Python Code. The original I\Q is created and fitted in Python while the interpolation and fitting is done in MATLAB.

Figure 3: Run ambsurf.m with the function AMISR_Pattern.m in your path and lp240_20 in the same 
directory.

Figure 4: Run ambsurfwtime.m with the function AMISR_Pattern.m in your path and lp240_20 in the same 
directory.

Figures 8, 10 and 11: Use plottingex2.m to create the figures. The data files
origdata.mat, origdata2.mat and patchex.mat will be required to run the code. The data can be
recreated by running the code in the python code library.

Figure 12:Use plottingstation.m to create the figure. The data files
origdatastation.mat, origdatastation2.mat and patchexstation.mat will be required to run the code. The data can be
recreated by running the code in the python code library.


Figures 14, and 15: Use plottingex4.m to create the figures. The data files
origdatatemp.mat and patchewtemp.mat will be required to run the code. The data can be
recreated by running the code in the python code library.
